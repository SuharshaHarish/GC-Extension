#### Coding style 
* Use sematic ui for styling, layout, icons, pagination e.t.c
* Follow ESLint rules for JS

#### Git style
* **commit message should be accurate** in explaining what the code does.

for eg: 
`Todo Screen: Add Listing of older to-do's`

`Displaying the history of to-do's will be helpful for a user`
`to know what are the goals/tasks have been compleated.`
`So add a list displaying all to-do's`

Observer the 1st line which tells which part(screen) of the
code will change.(i.e **Todo Screen:**)
use keyword "**Add**" for adding a feature & "**Fix**" for bug fixing 
after the 1st line leave a line of space then write detailed explanation
for the commit.
